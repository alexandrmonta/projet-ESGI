Project for the course GIT 2024. This project allows for exploring all the features of Git by simulating the operations of a restaurant. We are 3 persons on this project : Alexandre Montarulli, Rahmine Nedir and Lise Buniowski.

In the project, we showcase everything that characterizes a restaurant: its various areas (terrace, reception, foyer, kitchen, bar, restrooms, storage, office), the people involved in ensuring smooth service (servers, chefs, kitchen assistants, cleaning staff, accountant), and most importantly, the menu.

The commits rules are edited like this :

    [ADD] => added, (example : for a file added)
    [DEL] => deleted, (example : for a file removed)
    [MOD] => modified, (exammple : for a file modified)
    [UPD] => updated, (example : for a file updated)

The purpose of this project is to see if we understood the features and the goal of git fonctions and github. It will be evaluated thanks to :

    Quality of the defense
    Commits signed by all the contibutors
    Issue + issue templates
    Github project
    Readme, contributing, code of conduct
    .gitignore
    Respect of Git flow
    Hooks
    CI/Github actions
    Courses questions
